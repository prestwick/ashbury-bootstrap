				<h1>Business Plan</br>	<small>Ashbury MDM was formed to give parents analytics, alerts and intervention capabilities for their childrens' mobile phones and tablets.</small></h1>
			</div>
		</div>

			<h2>Problem</h2>
			<p class="detail">The average family cellular phone plan has four smart phones, two of which are for children under 18. Parents are unable to effectively monitor Internet usage in the mobile era, unlike when households had one desktop computer in the family room. Ineffective monitoring techniques, uneven application of mobile operating system parental controls, device lock codes and passwords, and hidden or deleted apps are complicating modern parenting.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="contain-b">
			<h2>Solution</h2>
			<p class="detail">Parent Cloud allows parents to stay in touch with their childrens' mobile habits, without touching their phones. This mobile SaaS builds a body of knowledge on the child's mobile application usage, mobile Interent surfing habits, real world visitation habits, and social contacts. Parents can choose to curb, restrict or ban sites and applications. The service can SMS or call the parent if the child violates the family rules for having a phone and tablet.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="contain-c">
			<h2>Why Now</h2>
			<p class="detail">Smart phone penetration in high schools and middle schools is nearing saturation and parents are not able to effectively monitor and provide feedback on their childrens' mobile activity. Mobile device management technology is empowering the world's largest companies to effectively adminster and mitigate employees bringing personally owned devices to work. Ashbury MDM applies the same technology to parental controls, putting the parents back in charge of the family devices.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="contain-b">
			<h2>Market Size</h2>
			<p class="detail">The total addressable market (TAM) is 30 million mobile devices owned by a subset of the 50 million children in the United States. Parents interested in influencing their childrens’ mobile usage is a serviceable addressable market (SAM) of 15 million devices. Approximately 250,000 devices already have third party parental control software from the top five vendors. Seed funding of under $1,000,000 will allow Ashbury MDM to build a fully featured mobile SaaS platform that can service up to 100,000 users. After this milestone, institutional funding of under $5,000,000 will allow Ashbury MDM to robust business and scale the platform to over 1,000,000 customers.</p>
